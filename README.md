# Choose Your Own Adventure

I built this project as a "proof of concept" for an end-of-year collaborative project between the Algebra and my Computer Science 1 classes.  It would also serve as a template for the CompSci students.

The idea was for the Algebra classes to write a "choose your own adventure" type story, and CompSci would build it.  Algebra would be responsible for all text, layouts and images.  Note: I do not remember (nor can discern) what math skill this reinforced.

For CompSci, this would do the following:
- Introduce GUI's using a text based system (Java Swing)
- Reinforce their understanding of Objects
- Reinforce their ability to create complex logic

Not all the text is completed, but it's placed so students can use the frames as needed.  But what is there gets a little snarky at times.

## The Story

Fred has been locked up for years when he finds the door's been left unlocked.  You must find your way out while collecting as much loot as possible.  Beware of the sleeping dragon and make sure you've got something to slay the ogre at the main gate.

**Good Luck!!**
