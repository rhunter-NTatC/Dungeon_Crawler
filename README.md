# Choose Your Own Adventure

I built this project as a "proof of concept" for an end-of-year collaborative project between the Algebra and my Computer Science 1 classes.  It would also serve as a template for the CompSci students.

The idea was for the Algebra classes to write a "choose your own adventure" type story, and CompSci would build it.  Algebra would be responsible for all text, layouts and images.  Note: I do not remember (nor can discern) what math skill this reinforced.

For CompSci, this would do the following:
- Introduce GUI's using a text based system
- Reinforce their understanding of Objects
- Reinforce their ability to create complex logic
